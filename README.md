# homekit-webos-picture-mode

This is a HomeKit Switch that uses the remote API of webOS tvs to change picture mode via the quick-switch menu.

Turning on the switch will move one slot to the left, turning it off will move back to the right.

Horribly unorganized and hacky, but it works for me (well, at least most of the time).
